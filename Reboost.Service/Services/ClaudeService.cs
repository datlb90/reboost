        string test3 = "In these days and ages, natural resources in the earth are gradually depleted by overexploitation of humans. This essay attempts to shed light on the dangers which have resulted from this tendency before outlining several viable solutions that should be adopted to tackle them.\nThere are two main dangers for using natural resources in the world at a high level. Firstly, it could cause the contamination of air. To illustrate, the overburning of carbon-intensive energy sources could create a host of exhaust fumes which is the primary reason for environmental pollution, so it has detrimental effects on people’s health for instance respiratory infection, asthma, lung cancer. Secondly, this problem is likely to have negative impacts on the financial crisis. To be more specific, the overexploitation of natural resources could lead to shortage of raw materials so it could create inflation which is one of the pressing issues for customers; therefore people would have a myriad of difficulties paying basic demand.\nTo combat this worrying issue, the following essential steps should be taken. One solution is that the government should introduce and develop alternative energy sources. Given that if people consume a host of clear energy resources including water energy, wind and solar energy, it could minimize human reliance on natural resources; for instance, wind turbines are now set up in many areas all over the world to produce a lot of electricity for daily activities. Another solution is that the authorities could heavily fine who overexploited which could act as a deterrent for those intending to have similar actions.\n\nIn conclusion, the overconsumption of natural resources in the world could lead to result in air pollution financial crisis, and it is crucial that the aforementioned measures including alternative energy and fining money be implemented to deal with this issue";

        string test6 = "In today's globalized world, there is no doubt that in this digital age, people tend to easily access to news via newspaper or TV thanks to the advanced technology. Therefore, there is a controversy that if this media tools show detailed descriptions of crime scenes, these will have a bad influence on the public. From my perspective, although I agree that this crime scenes might have a range of detrimental effects on the residents, I still believe that people can gain numerous benefits from this issue.\n\nOn the one hand, revealing some descriptions of criminal activities can negatively affect individuals for some reasons. First of all, it is severe to allow children to watch this type of scenes as they will immitate the criminal's action without awareness, therefore posing a threat to society about juvenile crimes. Moreover, these scenes might raise the fear among residents due to the feeling of having no protection, thereby lessening the reputation of police officer as they cannot prevent all unlawful acts.\n\nOn the other hand, this kind of news still has advantages among not only individuals but also the governments. First and foremost, crime scene plays a paramount important role in raising awareness among inhabitants about not committing a crime. For instance, if people observe some serious punishments that are put on prisoners, they will tend to eliminate criminal activities for their well-being. Additionally, the governments can easily impart a significant number of lessons through these detailed descriptions in order to teach children. For example, it is necessary to educate kids from a young age to not commit an offence, thereby, using crime scenes with colourful images can teach them more effectively.\n\nIn conclusion, I partly disagree that this kind of information should be restricted in the mass media due to its tremendous benefits that help form the society to ensure a better quality of life for residents.\n";

        string test9 = "  Due to the advancement of technology, video games have become ubiquitous and prevalent in our society. However, while many people reckon it as an effective pedagogical method, others dispute such notion and caution numerous crippling effects. This essay delves into both schools of thought and illustrates several personal assessments.\nOn the one hand, according to the advocates, video game holds merit in terms of education because of its peculiar and unparalled features. To begin with, it renders boring lessons into intriguing explorations thanks to the enhancing inclusitivity. In the past, studying at school is tantamount to reading out loud knowledge from the textbook, solving theoretical exercises and cramming dull knowledge into mind which sounds rather demoralizing for students, especially those who are not endowed with quick wit, resulting in relatively low academic grades. However, in this day and age, thanks to highly manipulative and appealing features of educational video games, ranging from controlling the character’s movement to completing missions, students are incentivized to pay more attention to the embedded lessons and make more attempts to absorb them to pass a level or to acclaim a virtual reward. As a consequence, the absorption process of students is hastened significantly and wields positive influences in their overall performance. \nNotwithstanding, those who hold a contradictory belief disprove such idea by pointing out high prospects of increasing game addiction. Indeed, if every class require students to engage in at least one match of game to complete the lesson, the frequency of game exposure will escalate significantly. Subsequently, despite its initial intention, this teaching method may backfire as pupils become dependent and addicted to games instead of just deploying them as an educating tool. This results in untold ramifications such as distraction, deteriorating studying morale and eventually worsening performance. \nIn recapitulation, the application of video games into teaching remains controversial as it has both considerable pros and cons. In my viewpoint, I have no objection to such an intersection as it has positive impact on enticing students’ engagement in educational pursuit. However, it should be used moderately so that no individual has to suffer from unwanted side-effect of it.  \n";
