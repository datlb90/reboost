In my opinion, the positive aspects of this trend are far overshadowed by the negative ones.\n\nOn the one hand, there are compelling reasons why antagonism between teenagers and their parents play a crucial role in the self-developing process. Firstly, when teenagers have several dissensions with their parents and resolve them, their relationship can be reinforced because parents would learn how to empathize with their children, which leads to the collective thoughts among the family and the members may understand each other thoroughly. Secondly, teenagers who undergo a few conflicts with their parents could develop specific skills such as problem-solving skills, critical thinking skills or conflict resolution skills. This may assist them effectively when integrating the environment with a new community or even when applying for a job. For instance, they can utilize those skills for job interviews, which may increase the opportunity of employment and also have a positive influence on the interviewers.\n\nOn the other hand, I would argue that teenage conflict should be avoided on account of its adverse impacts. First of all, in adolescence, children are easily affected by a host of problems and conflict with parents is not an exception.Therefore, usual quarrels can have a detrimental effect on teenages’ mental health, which may lead to several psychological diseases such as depression or anxiety disorders. For example, parents sometimes put pressure on their children regarding getting good grades, which causes an obsession of achievement among teenagers. Secondly, having an excessive number of disagreements could widen the generation gap among family members. Hence, teenagers can be isolated in their own family, which thus prompts their antipathy towards their parents.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are some merits of having conflict between teenagers and parents, I still approve of those who believe that this inclination should be alleviated in order to mitigate problems in adolescence.\n\nCung cấp đánh giá chi tiết và gợi ý cải thiện cho bài luận sử dụng định dạng JSON.

        string test3 = "In these days and ages, natural resources in the earth are gradually depleted by overexploitation of humans. This essay attempts to shed light on the dangers which have resulted from this tendency before outlining several viable solutions that should be adopted to tackle them.\nThere are two main dangers for using natural resources in the world at a high level. Firstly, it could cause the contamination of air. To illustrate, the overburning of carbon-intensive energy sources could create a host of exhaust fumes which is the primary reason for environmental pollution, so it has detrimental effects on people’s health for instance respiratory infection, asthma, lung cancer. Secondly, this problem is likely to have negative impacts on the financial crisis. To be more specific, the overexploitation of natural resources could lead to shortage of raw materials so it could create inflation which is one of the pressing issues for customers; therefore people would have a myriad of difficulties paying basic demand.\nTo combat this worrying issue, the following essential steps should be taken. One solution is that the government should introduce and develop alternative energy sources. Given that if people consume a host of clear energy resources including water energy, wind and solar energy, it could minimize human reliance on natural resources; for instance, wind turbines are now set up in many areas all over the world to produce a lot of electricity for daily activities. Another solution is that the authorities could heavily fine who overexploited which could act as a deterrent for those intending to have similar actions.\n\nIn conclusion, the overconsumption of natural resources in the world could lead to result in air pollution financial crisis, and it is crucial that the aforementioned measures including alternative energy and fining money be implemented to deal with this issue";
